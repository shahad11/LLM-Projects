# VectorDB

## 1) Hands-On: Building a Vector Database with OpenAI Embeddings Using LangChain

### ðŸ“‹ What Youâ€™ll Learn:

**Downloading and Loading Data:** Quickly fetch and prepare text data for processing.

**Splitting Documents:** Efficiently break down large text files into manageable chunks using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

**Generating Embeddings:** Learn how to create semantic embeddings for your text with OpenAIEmbeddings.

**Setting Up Chroma:** Build a Chroma vector database to store and manage your embeddings effectively.

**Retrieving Documents:** Implement a retriever to fetch relevant documents based on user queries.

**Creating a QA Chain:** Integrate the retriever with an OpenAI language model to answer questions dynamically.

### ðŸ’¡ Why Vector Databases?
Vector databases allow for powerful semantic searches and are essential for various AI applications, including chatbots, recommendation systems, and more.
