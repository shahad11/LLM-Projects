## 1) Text_to_Image_Generation_using_Stable_Diffusion

In this project, I explored the exciting world of **Stable Diffusion** by using pre-trained models like **Dreamlike Diffusion** and Stable Diffusion XL from Hugging Face. I worked with text prompts to generate stunning images and optimized the generation process by leveraging GPU acceleration (CUDA) for efficiency and memory optimization using torch.float16.

Through **negative prompting**, I guided the model to avoid unwanted elements in the generated images. Additionally, I fine-tuned various parameters such as:

**num_inference_steps:** Determining the number of denoising steps for higher quality.

**height and width:** Customizing the resolution of the generated images.

**num_images_per_prompt:** Generating multiple images for each text prompt.

The code is well-documented and structured to enable users to generate high-quality images easily. The project is perfect for anyone wanting to dive into text-to-image generation and experiment with a flexible and powerful model. All necessary explanations are provided so users with minimal knowledge of deep learning or data science can follow along.

Fork/Dowload this repository and try it out! It’s an exciting way to turn text into visuals with minimal setup, allowing you to explore creative outputs in no time.

## 2) Text_to_speech_generation_with_LLM

In this project, I explored how to transform written text into natural, human-like speech using Hugging Face's pre-trained models. The notebook demonstrates how to leverage powerful TTS models with minimal setup. Key components include:

Text Input Handling: Users can input any text, and the model converts it into speech.

Pre-trained Models: I utilized high-quality LLMs from Hugging Face for efficient TTS conversion.

Seamless Google Colab Integration: The notebook is designed for easy execution in Google Colab, allowing users to experience quick results without the hassle of local setups.

Detailed Explanations: Each code block is thoroughly explained, making the process accessible to people with even basic data science or deep learning knowledge.

The project offers flexibility, allowing users to customize the input text and experiment with different output voices and parameters. It’s an exciting foray into the world of AI-generated speech, offering high potential for applications in media, entertainment, and accessibility tools.

Feel free to fork the repository and run it in Google Colab—it’s fast, easy, and a lot of fun to explore the potential of text-to-speech conversion. All explanations are provided, so you can jump in even if you're new to TTS!
