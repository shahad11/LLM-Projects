## 2) Hands_on_How_to_Use_Prompt_Templates_in_LangChain

**üîç What are Prompt Templates?**

Prompt templates are an essential tool in AI development that allow you to create structured, reusable prompts. Instead of writing unique prompts for every task, prompt templates let you use placeholders for dynamic inputs making your AI workflows efficient and consistent. This approach is especially useful in applications like text generation, summarization, and translation, where you can swap out variables for specific tasks.

**üìò What‚Äôs Inside the Notebook:**

- A step-by-step guide on creating prompt templates with LangChain.
- Code snippets that show how to pass dynamic variables into prompt templates.
- Multiple Examples such as generating a fancy name for a restaurant or creating catchy slogans for products.
- Full explanation of how to format templates for various use cases, ensuring modular and scalable AI development.
- Easy-to-follow structure that can be quickly replicated in Google Colab, making it accessible for developers at any level.

## 4)üöÄ Hands-On Project: Using Agents and Tools in LangChain ü§ñ

In the world of LangChain, agents are powerful components that enable language models to perform tasks and make decisions by interacting with external tools. These agents can dynamically plan, execute, and manage workflows, making your AI applications more intelligent and adaptive. Tools, on the other hand, extend the capabilities of LLMs, allowing them to access APIs, databases, or even perform actions like web scraping.

I'm excited to share my latest hands-on project that walks you through how to implement agents and tools in LangChain! üåü
